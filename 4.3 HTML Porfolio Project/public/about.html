<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Basically I like to go nuts at the gym, ride my bike through the city, and not get hit by cars.</p>

<p>
    I studied Finance at the University of South Carolina, graduating with a bachelors of science in 2016. Since then I
    have worked as a tutor, high school teacher, waiter, financial analyst, and hopefully soon as a developer.
</p>

<p>
    I hope to find a role as a junior developer where i can continue to improve my skills, provide value, and become the
    best version of myself possible.
